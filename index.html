                                <p>The project aims to analyze sales data to extract insights that enhance marketing strategies and increase revenue. The analysis focuses on identifying the highest revenue-generating regions, the best-selling and most profitable products, and the impact of pricing on average order value. It also examines peak purchasing times to understand customer behavior and identifies frequently purchased product combinations to optimize cross-selling strategies. These insights are presented through an interactive dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.</p>

                                <p>The data was cleaned using Power Query, addressing date formatting issues to ensure accurate time-based analysis. Power Pivot was then used to calculate key performance metrics such as revenue, average order value, and percentage growth. Pivot Tables were utilized to analyze the relationship between order volume and revenue. Finally, an interactive dashboard was designed to visually present the insights, enabling efficient business decision-making.</p>

The best-selling and most profitable products were identified, helping refine pricing strategies and promotional offers. The study of purchasing times highlighted peak periods that can be leveraged for marketing and inventory planning. Frequently purchased product combinations were also discovered, supporting cross-selling strategies. The interactive dashboard provided a clear and quick overview of sales performance, facilitating data-driven decision-making.</p>
